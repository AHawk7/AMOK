Readme For Robopet.

You have run a Pet Shelter for many years, that takes in Cats and Dogs, and cares for them until they are adopted.

A couple of years ago, Robot Cats and Dogs became very popular suddenly, but now they are not, and many have been abandoned.

You have been called on to take in as many robots as possible, and try to arrange for their adoption, along with the Cats and Dogs, you already have in your shelter.

Robot Cats and Dogs are different from organic pets since they do not require to be cleaned, fed, played with, or watered, daily. And they do not require habitats to be cleaned, like cages or kitty litter.

A Robot Cat or Dog, are essentially identical to each other, except only in shell appearance, and only require a weekly oil change, and have to vacuum cleaned every 5 days or dirt clogs their internals, and charged daily like a smartphone.

As the manager of the Pet Shelter, you have to change your shelter's existing computer program to track pets and pet adoptions, with as little change as possible to your present program.

1) Create a program that accepts Cats and Dogs into a shelter, and monitors their condition and care.

2) Do modifications on the program to allow robots, using as little additional coding as possible, and put these changes into the comments.

3) A robot cat or dog are entered into the shelter, and adopted out of the shelter, as you would an organic cat or dog.  But, treat their care as if they were identical robots, not as a new species of pets under the shelter's care.   These are cats and dogs, with diffrent methods of care than organics, even though they are the same robot being with a different shell of cat or dog.

4) Track their entry and adoption, allow for searches by name of each kind of pet, for adoption, care, and maintainance.  Track the number of days each pet has been in the shelter.  Use Hash Maps to organize the pets.

5) You already have pets existing in your shelter, before you begin the acceptance and adoption of robots with cat and dog shells.  Minimum 4 organic dogs and 4 organic cats in your shelter's database.
Be able to list their names, species, and condition.
 
Stretch Tasks

1) Give a daily time component to the shelter.  Limit the amount of activity (tasks) allowable with the pets, given a number of working hours per day.

2) Give a money component to the shelter.  Each activity cost money, so you can only buy as much grooming supplies, food or kitty litter every week.  You operate on a daily or weekly budget. 

3) Administrative duties. Have non-pet related tasks, that affect the pets.  Like asking for volunteers, or hiring help, to increase the number of activities that can be done with the pets.  (This also costs money to hire help.)  Also, include options to ask for donations, or government grants to help increase the shelter's budget.

4) Random emergency.  You require a hospital visit to treat a sick dog or cat.  Or an engineer to repair or reprogam a robotic pet.  Or make it random whether a dog or cat gets adopted.  

5) TDD.
